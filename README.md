# Target audience 

All people that are interested in Scandinavian design and have a passion and interest for sustainability and creating better products with a smaller footprint. The website is fairly basic but with an intention to give the user a preview of the digital and print publication. A short description of the publication together with images and a video to explain the concept of Slow Design on the landing page showcasting typical content from this publication. On the info page there is a scrolling gallery with beautiful images to show examples of material from the publication. Then there is a subscribe page to sign up for the publication.

# Design
The idea was to keep the aesthetic aligned with the concept of Slow Design in mind. Less is more, with a focus on clean and minimalistic design. I also wanted the website to have a feeling of a printed magazine, therefore I chose to use a serif font. Which is typically used for printed magazines.

## Frameworks and libraries

### Github
I used Github for storage of my website. 

### Codeanywhere 
The IDE I used was Codeanywhere for coding and pushing changes. 

# Deployment 

I deployed everything from the website onto github-pages. Following the guide from Love running. 

# Testing

All pages have been tested on 

### Jigsaw CSS validator 

### W3C validator 

### Lighthouse 
I have used Chrome's Lighthouse tool, to check the performance of Slow Design. At first it was slowed down by large images (jpg format). I then converted all images to webp by using https://cloudconvert.com/webp-converter which made a big difference. Below are the final result after using the image converter.

## Full Testing 

Full testing was performed on the following devices

-   Laptop:
    -   MacBook Pro 
-   Mobile Devices:
    -   Iphone 12

On these devices I used Google Chrome and Safari to test the website. 

My husband and family made additional tests on their devices with different screen sizes to see how it looked.
