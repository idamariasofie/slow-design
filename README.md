# Target audience 

All people that are interested in Scandinavian design and have a passion and interest for sustainability and creating better products with a smaller footprint. The website is fairly basic but with an intention to give the user a preview of the digital and print publication. A short description of the publication together with images and a video to explain the concept of Slow Design on the landing page showcasting typical content from this publication. On the info page there is a scrolling gallery with beautiful images to show examples of material from the publication. Then there is a subscribe page to sign up for the publication. 

## User experience 
The content of the Slow Design website will not change too much over time, but new images, interviews and articles would be added over time. 

Create an understanding of the publication:
Through the imageson the website and the video the intention is to show the user the type of content they would get in the publication. Creating an interest and a feeling of inside information from the new up and coming designers and brands creating exciting concepts and products. 

Make subscription easy:
On the subscribe page there is a clearly visible form and subscribe button, making it easy for users to sign up. 
In the footer section there are several ways to contact Slow Design via their social channels. 

Make all content user friendly on different devices:
By using suitable media queries and checking these throughout the process, the website is designed with a focus on mobile first. Using flexbox to adapt wider screen content down to smaller sized content. 

# Design
The idea was to keep the aesthetic aligned with the concept of Slow Design. Less is more, with a focus on clean and minimalistic design. I also wanted the website to have a feeling of a printed magazine, therefore I chose to use a serif font. Which is typically used for printed magazines. 

## Typography
Lora was selected as the font for the website, to give it an authentic feeling of a printed magazine. 


## Imagery
All images were carefully selected to fit the theme, and the products I imagine they would cover to get users interested and wanting to subscribe. 

## Wireframes
My wireframes for the website was designed in Balsamiq. I have used the original wireframes as the basic structure for the website, but these have also been devloped through the process. When I realised some material and placement of these would be better changed. I think the wireframes will be a more helpful tool going forward and when my knowledge grows. 


# Features

## General features on each page

Navbar
Below are two views of the navbar on the desktop view and the responsive mobile view, where it transforms into a hamburger menu. 


Mobile view 



Footer with social media icons to Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram
I added four social media icons to link to Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. They are sourced from Font awesome and in black to align with the rest of the website. 

# Features by page

## Landing page 
On this page I wanted the user to get a feeling of the visual identity of the publication directly. 
This page has a carefully selected hero image, a short introduction text, a smaller image linked to the info page and a video explaining the concept of Slow Design. Below each section page dividers has been added to create more space and structure. 

## Info page
This page shows a scrolling image gallery showing the typical content of the publication and some of the brands within Slow Design and sustainability. 

## Subscribe page 
This page was designed with a form to subscribe to the digital and printed publication. 

## Future ideas
For the future, I would like to add more pages with interviews and articles within the field, and being able to scroll through these. 


# Technology

### Github
Codeanywhere, the IDE for coding and pushing all changes 
Github, for storage of my website
Python - via terminal to preview my website
HTML5 - the core was built using HTML version 5
CSS - was used to style the website 
Youtube - embeded a link to a youtube video on the landing page about Slow design 
Font awesome - I used icons and font from Font awesome 
Google chrome - Slow design was built and tested with Google Chrome

### Codeanywhere 
The IDE I used was Codeanywhere for coding and pushing changes. 

# Deployment 

I deployed everything from the website onto github-pages. Following the guide from Love running. 

# Testing

All pages have been tested on 

### Jigsaw CSS validator 

### W3C validator 

### Lighthouse 
I have used Chrome's Lighthouse tool, to check the performance of Slow Design. At first it was slowed down by large images (jpg format). I then converted all images to webp by using https://cloudconvert.com/webp-converter which made a big difference. Below are the final result after using the image converter. 

### Wave 

## Full Testing 

Full testing was performed on the following devices

-   Laptop:
    -   MacBook Pro 
-   Mobile Devices:
    -   Iphone 12

On these devices I used Google Chrome and Safari to test the website. 

My husband and family made additional tests on their devices with different screen sizes to see how it looked.
