This is the static website of Slow Design [https://idamariasofie.github.io/slow-design/](https://idamariasofie.github.io/slow-design/). A print and digital publication dedicated to Slow Design, a collaborative way of designing and creating products made to last longer. From high quality products, to interviews with creative people, to video content, the mission is to showcase and support the local Scandinavian design community, with a focus on sustainabilty.

# Target audience

All people that are interested in Scandinavian design and have a passion and interest for sustainability and creating better products with a smaller footprint. The website is fairly basic but with an intention to give the user a preview of the digital and print publication. A short description of the publication together with images and a video to explain the concept of Slow Design on the landing page showcasting typical content from this publication. On the info page there is a scrolling gallery with beautiful images to show examples of material from the publication. Then there is a subscribe page to sign up for the publication.

## User experience

The content of the Slow Design website will not change too much over time, but new images, interviews and articles would be added over time.

Create an understanding of the publication:
Through the imageson the website and the video the intention is to show the user the type of content they would get in the publication. Creating an interest and a feeling of inside information from the new up and coming designers and brands creating exciting concepts and products.

Make subscription easy:
On the subscribe page there is a clearly visible form and subscribe button, making it easy for users to sign up.
In the footer section there are several ways to contact Slow Design via their social channels.

Make all content user friendly on different devices:
By using suitable media queries and checking these throughout the process, the website is designed with a focus on mobile first. Using flexbox to adapt wider screen content down to smaller sized content.

## User stories

Below are three descriptions of personas I visualized when designing the Slow Design website.

Persona 1:
30-60 years, education in design/ architecture/ lifestyle. Has a personal interest in Slow living and creating a better life with high quality products as a part of it.

Persona 2:
30-60 years, educator within the field of design, want to be informed about the latest updates within sustainable design and what is coming next. Upcoming brands etc.

Persona 3:
30- 60 years, working with trend-forecasting, with a focus on the Scandinavian market. Wants to stay updated on several fields of design.

# Design

The idea was to keep the aesthetic aligned with the concept of Slow Design. Less is more, with a focus on clean and minimalistic design. I also wanted the website to have a feeling of a printed magazine, therefore I chose to use a serif font. Which is typically used for printed magazines.

## Color palette

The colors of the website were kept basic to be in line with Slow Design. A way of creating a clean base to let the imagery stand out and take space.

## Typography

Lora was selected as the font for the website, to give it an authentic feeling of a printed magazine.

## Imagery

All images were carefully selected to fit the theme, and the products I imagine they would cover to get users interested and wanting to subscribe.

## Wireframes

My wireframes for the website was designed in Balsamiq. I have used the original wireframes as the basic structure for the website, but these have also been devloped through the process. When I realised some material and placement of these would be better changed. I think the wireframes will be a more helpful tool going forward and when my knowledge grows.

Footer with social media icons to Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram
I added four social media icons to link to Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. They are sourced from Font awesome and in black to align with the rest of the website.

# Features by page

## Landing page

On this page I wanted the user to get a feeling of the visual identity of the publication directly.
This page has a carefully selected hero image, a short introduction text, a smaller image linked to the info page and a video explaining the concept of Slow Design. Below each section page dividers has been added to create more space and structure.

# Unfixed Bugs

I found a bug when I decided to change the image on subscribe page to a background image. This was due to the fact that I had forgot to remove the former image from the subscribe.html page. I removed this and made sure it was working as intended.

Fixed bug

# Testing

All pages have been tested on

### Jigsaw CSS validator

Jigsaw was used to validate the css code

Pass after testing CSS

### W3C validator

W3C was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website

index.html - pass

### Lighthouse

I have used Chrome's Lighthouse tool, to check the performance of Slow Design. At first it was slowed down by large images (jpg format). I then converted all images to webp by using <https://cloudconvert.com/webp-converter> which made a big difference. Below are the final result after using the image converter.

## Full Testing

Full testing was performed on the following devices

- Laptop:
  - MacBook Pro
- Mobile Devices:

On these devices I used Google Chrome and Safari to test the website.

My husband and family made additional tests on their devices with different screen sizes to see how it looked.
